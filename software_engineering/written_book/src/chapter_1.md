# What is Software Engineering?
Software Engineering is an engineering branch associated with development of software product using well-defined scientific principles, methods and procedures.  
The outcome of software engineering is an efficient and reliable software product.  
Software Engineering:  
- Planning
- Analysis
- Development
- Implementation
- Programming
- Desgin
- Testing
- V & V
# Why we need to study SE?
- Software Engineering is the most well-paid job
- Excellent job opportunity
- High demand job across the Globe
# A day in life of a software engineer
## Entry-Level Software Engineer
- Implement new features
- learn new languages & frameworks
- Maintain existing code
- Pair Programming
- Resolve simple bugs/errors
- Refactor code
- Practice test driven development (TDD)
## Senior Software Engineer
- Decide which framework & libraries to use
- Architect API endpoints & data models

6. Empathize with End Users
# Software engineering overview
Software = Code + Libraries + docs  
A program = is an executable code Software Product = specific requirement (HRMIS)  
Engineering = well-defined, scientific principles, methods  
Software Engineering = developing efficient and reliable software product using engineering mechanism.

Software Product:
- Requirement
- System Analysis
- System Design
- Code Design
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance
- Update
# What is Software engineering in current situation?
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is connected with all aspects of software production which is
- Robust/Bug-free software
- deliver on time
- within budget plan
- satisfy client's requirements 
# Software evolution
Software evolution is the continual development of a piece of software after its initial release to address changing stakeholder and/or market requirements.
- Change request 
- Impact analysis
- Release Planning
- System update
- System release
# Software evolution law (prof. Many Lehman, 1974)
1. Static-type (S-type): works strictly according to defined specifications and solutions. The s-type software is least subjected to changes. For example, calculator program for mathematical computation.
2. Practical-type (P-type): This is a software with a collection of procedures. Change in P-type software are not continuous. For example, gaming software
3. Embedded-type (E-type): This software works closely as the requirement of real-world environment. This software has a high degree of changes as there are various changes in laws, taxes, etc.
in the real world situation. For example, Online trading software.
# E-type software evolution
1. Continuing change: continue to adapt to the real world changes, else less useful
2. Increasing complexity: its complexity tends to increase unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
3. Conservation of familiarity: The familiarity must be retained at any cose, to implement the changes in the system.
4. Continuting growth: to resolve some business problem, its size of implementing the changes grows according to the lifestyle changes of the business.
5. Reducing quality: changing operational environment
6. Feedback system: multi-level feedback to be successfully modified or improved.
7. Self-regulation: self-regulating with the distribution of product and process
8. Organizational stability: The average effective global activity rate in an evolving over the lifetime of the product
