### 1.1 The Role of Information Systems in Business Today

Information systems (IS) have fundamentally reshaped the business landscape. Businesses are making massive investments in information technology to stay competitive.

*   **Business Transformation:** The use of mobile devices, e-commerce, online conferencing, and social networking has become integral to business operations. Supply chains are now faster and more data-driven, relying on principles like just-in-time inventory.

*   **What's New in MIS:** The field is characterized by continuous change in three key areas:
    *   **Technology:** The rise of the mobile digital platform, the growing use of "big data" for insights, and the expansion of cloud computing.
    *   **Management:** Increased use of online collaboration tools, advanced business intelligence applications for real-time decision-making, and virtual meetings to reduce costs and improve collaboration.
    *   **Organizations:** The emergence of "social business" using platforms like Facebook and Twitter, a growing trend of telework, and the co-creation of value with customers and suppliers.

*   **Globalization:** The Internet has created a "flattened world," reducing the economic and cultural barriers between nations. This presents both challenges, such as the offshoring of jobs, and opportunities, like accessing a global marketplace. Information systems are the key enablers of this globalization.

*   **The Emerging Digital Firm:** This is a firm where most significant business relationships and core processes are digitally enabled. These firms are more agile and can operate 24/7 across the globe, a concept known as time and space shifting.

*   **Strategic Business Objectives:** Firms invest heavily in IS to achieve six primary strategic goals:
    1.  **Operational Excellence:** Improving efficiency and profitability (e.g., Walmart's Retail Link system).
    2.  **New Products, Services, and Business Models:** Creating innovative offerings (e.g., Apple's iTunes).
    3.  **Customer and Supplier Intimacy:** Building strong relationships to increase sales and lower costs.
    4.  **Improved Decision Making:** Using real-time data to make more informed decisions.
    5.  **Competitive Advantage:** Achieving the above objectives to outperform rivals.
    6.  **Survival:** Adopting systems that have become industry necessities (e.g., ATMs in banking).

### 1.2 Perspectives on Information Systems

To understand information systems, one must look beyond the technology itself.

*   **What Is an Information System?:**
    *   **Definition:** A set of components that collect, process, store, and distribute information to support decision-making and control.
    *   **Core Activities:** It transforms raw **data** into meaningful **information** through three activities: **input**, **processing**, and **output**. **Feedback** is a crucial component for evaluation and correction.

*   **Dimensions of Information Systems:** A holistic understanding requires knowledge of three dimensions:
    *   **Organizations:** IS are embedded in the structure, culture, and business processes of an organization. This includes its hierarchy (senior, middle, operational management) and its various business functions (e.g., sales, finance).
    *   **Management:** Managers set the strategy for how IS will be used, make decisions based on the information provided, and lead organizational change.
    *   **Technology:** This includes computer hardware, software, data management technology, and telecommunications networks. The combination of these elements forms the firm's **IT infrastructure**.

*   **A Business Perspective:** From a business viewpoint, an information system is a tool for creating value. It is an organizational and management solution to a business challenge.

*   **Complementary Assets:** Simply investing in technology is not enough to guarantee good returns. Firms must also invest in **complementary assets**, which are the organizational, managerial, and social assets required to derive value from a primary investment. This includes things like supportive business culture, new business processes, management support, and training.

### 1.3 Contemporary Approaches to Information Systems

The study of information systems is a multidisciplinary field with two major approaches:

*   **Technical Approach:** This approach uses mathematical models and focuses on the physical technology and formal capabilities of systems. It draws from disciplines like computer science, management science, and operations research.

*   **Behavioral Approach:** This approach focuses on the human and organizational aspects of systems, such as strategic integration, design, and implementation. It draws from sociology, psychology, and economics.

*   **Sociotechnical Systems Perspective:** This book adopts a **sociotechnical view**, which sees optimal performance as being achieved by jointly optimizing both the social and technical systems. It recognizes that technology and the organization must mutually adjust to one another for an information system to be successful.
