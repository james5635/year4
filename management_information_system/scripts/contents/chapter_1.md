inland is a leader in the timber machine industry. The Finnish company Ponsse is one 
of the largest manufacturers of rubber-wheel cut-to-length forest machines. The timber 
industry uses two cutting methods: the cut-to-length method and the tree-length method. 
With the cut-to-length method, tree trunks are cut in the forest into various sized logs for 
different uses, such as saw logs or pulpwood. With the tree-length method, trunks are cut in the 
forest and transported to the mill whole or almost whole. At the mill, trunk pieces are separated 
according to use. Approximately 45 percent of the world’s harvest is harvested with cut-to-length 
machines, like those produced by Ponsse, and 35 percent of this yield is harvested using the cut-
to-length method.
Ponsse’s main products are harvesters, harvester cutting heads, forwarders, and cranes. A har-
vester is a tractor-like machine used for cutting logs. It has a crane with a cutting head, which 
grasps the tree at the stem and uses its saw to make the first cut. Then the head moves the 
cut tree trunk in its “jaws” and finds the next cutting points. During the movement, the cutting 
head removes the branches of the tree. A forwarder is a special forest tractor with a crane that is 
designed for efficient trunk collection and transportation.
Ponsse also offers its clients an integrated set of sophisticated information systems. “Ponsse 
wants to know the business of its clients, because it sells forest machines and information sys-
tems to all partners in the logistic chain,” says Information Systems Product Manager Hanna 
Vilkman. These information systems support the entire wood procurement chain. The first step 
in this chain is to estimate the demand for different types and sizes of timber. T ypically, this is 
done in the field office of a wood purchasing organization. With the help of information systems, 
a cutting plan is created that will optimize the cutting yield for a particular logging area. Data on 
similar areas that were logged previously are used in order to optimize the cutting plan. A map 
of the logging area is also produced, as well 
as working instructions for the harvester 
driver. The map describes the borders of 
the logging area as well as areas to be pro-
tected. Should a single tree need to be left 
uncut, it is marked manually with a plastic 
stripe.
The harvester driver gets the map and 
working instructions via a dedicated e-mail 
system that transfers data between the har-
vester’s information system and the wood 
purchase organization. Instructions and 
maps are presented on a display located 
in the harvester cabin. A special feature in 
the harvester’s information system enables 
it to optimize the cutting of a log into pieces 
during the cutting process. This means 
that the system is able to calculate the opti-
mal cutting places when the log is moving 
through the cutting head, after being first 
cut from the stem. After the trees have 
been cut according to the instructions, the 
driver sends the harvest information to 
the field office via a dedicated e-mail sys-
tem. The assortment typically contains 10 
different types of cut logs of five different

lengths. The harvester marks each type with a different color spot in order to help 
the forwarder to sort each log into its correct pile.
Forwarders (special forest tractors) use a map application and GPS position-
ing to transport the cut logs from the forest to the roadside. This facilitates work 
and improves safety, because the system warns the operator when the machine 
is approaching dangerous hazards, such as power lines. Piles of cut logs are then 
transported from the roadside to factories by trucks that also use information sys-
tems, for example, to find optimal routes.
Drivers of harvesters and foresters can learn the skills required to operate their 
machines by using 3D simulators that simulate real-world conditions. A driver can 
sit in a simulated machine and control the machine using the levers, just like they 
would in the field. The forest landscape is reflected as a 3D image on a canvas, and 
the operator can move freely within the harvesting area and view the forest from 
different angles.

P
onsse has well-functioning, cooperative information systems that link 
together the various parties of the wood production and procurement 
chain, such as the forest owner, the wood-purchasing organization, the forest 
machine owner and operator, and the manufacturing plant that uses the wood 
cut from the forest. The systems benefit all parties. Some of the information sys-
tems provided by Ponsse are integral parts of forest machinery, like those embed-
ded in harvesters and forwarders; others are products that can be purchased. 
Information flows between these parties automatically. The availability of these 
kinds of information systems boosts the selling of Ponsse’s main products, the 
forest machines. The harvester information system guides the machine and gath-
ers exact information on how the machine is being operated and the details of 
the yield. The company that owns the forest machine can monitor the machine’s 
utilization and the distribution of working hours and sequences, for example. 
The harvester driver can adjust the harvester operating settings according to 
his or her own preferences. The forest field office gets information from several 
sources, such as harvester operations in the forest, the trucks, or the factory. All 
of this makes the management of the various phases of the wood procurement 
chain more efficient. Harvester and forwarder information systems also enhance 
the ecological treatment of forests by highlighting areas to be avoided.

1.1 THE ROLE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN 
BUSINESS TODAY
I
t’s not business as usual in America anymore, or the rest of the global 
economy. In 2012, American businesses will spend over $540 billion on 
information systems hardware, software, and telecommunications equip-
ment. In addition, they will spend another $650 billion on business and 
management consulting and services—much of which involves redesign-
ing firms’ business operations to take advantage of these new technologies. 
Figure 1.1 shows that between 1980 and 2011, private business investment in 
 information technology consisting of hardware, software, and communications 
 equipment grew from 32 percent to 52 percent of all invested capital.
As managers, most of you will work for firms that are intensively using 
information systems and making large investments in information technol-
ogy. You will certainly want to know how to invest this money wisely. If 
you make wise choices, your firm can outperform competitors. If you make 
poor choices, you will be wasting valuable capital. This book is dedicated to 
 helping you make wise decisions about information technology and informa-
tion systems.
HOW INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE TRANSFORMING 
BUSINESS
You can see the results of this massive spending around you every day by 
observing how people conduct business. More wireless cell phone accounts 
were opened in 2012 than telephone landlines installed. Smartphones,  texting, 
e-mail, and online conferencing have all become essential tools of business. 
One hundred twenty-two million people in the United States access the Internet 
using mobile devices in 2012, which is half of the total Internet user population

(eMarketer, 2010). There are 242 million cell phone subscribers in the United 
States, and nearly 5 billion worldwide (ITU, 2011).
By June 2012, more than 104 million businesses worldwide had dot-com 
Internet sites registered (Whois, 2012). T oday, 184 million Americans shop 
online, and 150 million have purchased online. Every day about 67 million 
Americans go online to research a product or service.
In 2012, FedEx moved over 9 million packages daily worldwide (6 million 
in the United States), mostly overnight, and the United Parcel Service (UPS) 
moved over 15 million packages daily worldwide. Businesses sought to sense 
and respond to rapidly changing customer demand, reduce inventories to the 
lowest possible levels, and achieve higher levels of operational efficiency. 
Supply chains have become more fast-paced, with companies of all sizes 
depending on just-in-time inventory to reduce their overhead costs and get to 
market faster.
As newspaper readership continues to decline, more than 150 million people 
read a newspaper online, and millions more read other news sites. About 67 
million people watch a video online every day, 76 million read a blog, and 26 
million post to blogs, creating an explosion of new writers and new forms of 
customer feedback that did not exist five years ago (Pew, 2012). Social network-
ing site Facebook attracted 162 million monthly visitors in 2012 in the United 
States, and over 900 million worldwide. Google+ has attracted over 100  million 
users in the United States. Businesses are starting to use social networking tools 
to connect their employees, customers, and managers worldwide. Many Fortune 
500 companies now have Facebook pages, T witter accounts, and T umblr sites. 
Despite the economic slowdown, e-commerce and Internet advertising con-
tinue to expand. Google’s online ad revenues surpassed $36 billion in 2011, and 
Internet advertising continues to grow at more than 10 percent a year, reaching 
more than $39.5 billion in revenues in 2012.
New federal security and accounting laws, requiring many businesses to 
keep e-mail messages for five years, coupled with existing occupational and 
health laws requiring firms to store employee chemical exposure data for up to 
60 years, are spurring the annual growth of digital information at the estimated 
rate of 5 exabytes annually, equivalent to 37,000 new Libraries of Congress.
WHAT’S NEW IN MANAGEMENT INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS?
Lots! What makes management information systems the most exciting topic in 
business is the continual change in technology, management use of the tech-
nology, and the impact on business success. New businesses and industries 
appear, old ones decline, and successful firms are those that learn how to use 
the new technologies. T able 1.1 summarizes the major new themes in business 
uses of information systems. These themes will appear throughout the book in 
all the chapters, so it might be a good idea to take some time now and discuss 
these with your professor and other students.
There are three interrelated changes in the technology area: (1) the 
 emerging mobile digital  platform, (2) the growing business use of "big data," 
and (3) the growth in “cloud computing,” where more and more business 
 software runs over the Internet.
IPhones, iPads, BlackBerrys, and Android tablets and smartphones are not 
just gadgets or entertainment outlets. They represent new emerging comput-
ing platforms based on an array of new hardware and software technologies.

TABLE 1.1 WHAT’S NEW IN MIS
CHANGE BUSINESS IMPACT 
TECHNOLOGY
Cloud computing platform emerges as a major business area of 
innovation 
A flexible collection of computers on the Internet begins to perform 
tasks traditionally performed on corporate computers. Major business 
applications are delivered online as an Internet service (Software as a 
Service, or SaaS).
Big data Businesses look for insights from huge volumes of data from Web traffic, 
e-mail messages, social media content, and machines (sensors) that 
require new data management tools to capture, store, and analyze.
A mobile digital platform emerges to compete with the PC as a 
business system
The Apple iPhone and Android mobile devices are able to download 
hundreds of thousands of applications to support collaboration, 
location-based services, and communication with colleagues. Small 
tablet computers, including the iPad, Google Nexus, and Kindle Fire, 
challenge conventional laptops as platforms for consumer and 
corporate computing.
MANAGEMENT
Managers adopt online collaboration and social networking software 
to improve coordination, collaboration, and knowledge sharing
Google Apps, Google Sites, Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services, 
and IBM Lotus Connections are used by over 100 million business 
professionals worldwide to support blogs, project management, online 
meetings, personal profiles, social bookmarks, and online communities.
Business intelligence applications accelerate More powerful data analytics and interactive dashboards provide  real-
time performance information to managers to enhance decision 
making.
Virtual meetings proliferate Managers adopt telepresence videoconferencing and Web conferencing 
technologies to reduce travel time, and cost, while improving 
collaboration and decision making. 
ORGANIZATIONS
Social business Businesses use social networking platforms, including Facebook, 
Twitter, and internal corporate social tools, to deepen interactions with 
employees, customers, and suppliers. Employees use blogs, wikis, 
e-mail texting, and messaging to interact in online communities. 
Telework gains momentum in the workplace The Internet, wireless laptops, smartphones, and tablet computers 
make it possible for growing numbers of people to work away from the 
traditional office. Fifty-five percent of U.S. businesses have some form 
of remote work program.
Co-creation of business value Sources of business value shift from products to solutions and 
experiences, and from internal sources to networks of suppliers and 
collaboration with customers. Supply chains and product development 
become more global and collaborative; customer interactions help 
firms define new products and services.
More and more business computing is moving from PCs and desktop machines 
to these mobile devices. Managers are increasingly using these devices to 
coordinate work, communicate with employees, and provide information for 
decision making. We call these developments the “emerging mobile digital 
platform.”
 Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 37

Managers routinely use online collaboration and social technologies in 
order to make better, faster decisions. As management behavior changes, how 
work gets organized, coordinated, and measured also changes. By connect-
ing employees working on teams and projects, the social network is where 
works gets done, where plans are executed, and where managers manage. 
Collaboration spaces are where employees meet one another—even when 
they are separated by continents and time zones.
The strength of cloud computing and the growth of the mobile digital  platform 
allow organizations to rely more on telework, remote work, and  distributed 
decision making. This same platform means firms can outsource more work, 
and rely on markets (rather than employees) to build value. It also means that 
firms can collaborate with suppliers and customers to create new products, or 
make existing products more efficiently.
You can see some of these trends at work in the Interactive Session on 
Management. Millions of managers rely heavily on the mobile digital  platform 
to coordinate suppliers and shipments, satisfy customers, and manage their 
employees. A business day without these mobile devices or Internet access 
would be unthinkable. As you read this case, note how the emerging mobile 
platform greatly enhances the accuracy, speed, and richness of decision 
 making.
GLOBALIZATION CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES: A 
FLATTENED WORLD
In 1492, Columbus reaffirmed what astronomers were long saying: the world 
was round and the seas could be safely sailed. As it turned out, the world was 
populated by peoples and languages living in isolation from one another, with 
great disparities in economic and scientific development. The world trade that 
ensued after Columbus’s voyages has brought these peoples and cultures closer. 
The “industrial revolution” was really a world-wide phenomenon energized by 
expansion of trade among nations.
In 2005, journalist Thomas Friedman wrote an influential book declaring the 
world was now “flat,” by which he meant that the Internet and global commu-
nications had greatly reduced the economic and cultural advantages of devel-
oped countries. Friedman argued that the U.S. and European countries were 
in a fight for their economic lives, competing for jobs, markets, resources, and 
even ideas with highly educated, motivated populations in low-wage areas in 
the less developed world (Friedman, 2007). This “globalization” presents both 
 challenges and opportunities for business firms
A growing percentage of the economy of the United States and other 
advanced industrial countries in Europe and Asia depends on imports and 
exports. In 2012, more than 33 percent of the U.S. economy resulted from 
foreign trade, both imports and exports. In Europe and Asia, the number 
exceeded 50 percent. Many Fortune 500 U.S. firms derive half their revenues 
from foreign operations. For instance, 85 percent of Intel’s revenues in 2011 
came from overseas sales of its microprocessors. Eighty percent of the toys 
sold in the United States are manufactured in China, while about 90 percent 
of the PCs  manufactured in China use American-made Intel or Advanced 
Micro Design (AMD) chips.
It’s not just goods that move across borders. So too do jobs, some of them 
high-level jobs that pay well and require a college degree. In the past decade, 
the United States lost several million manufacturing jobs to offshore, low-wage

Can you run your company from the palm of your 
hand? Perhaps not entirely, but there are many 
functions today that can be performed using an 
iPhone, iPad, BlackBerry, or other mobile handheld 
device.
The BlackBerry used to be the favorite mobile 
handheld for business because it was optimized 
for e-mail and messaging, with strong security 
and tools for accessing internal corporate sys-
tems. Now that’s changing. Companies large 
and small are starting to deploy Apple’s iPhone 
and iPad as well as Android mobile devices to 
conduct more of their work. They are enhanc-
ing their security systems so that mobile users 
can remotely accessing proprietary corporate 
resources with confidence. 
For some, these handhelds have become indis-
pensible. Eric Jackson is a champion kayaker who 
spends half of each year following competitions 
and events throughout North America. He’s also 
president of Jackson Kayak, the leading whitewater 
kayak manufacturer. It’s essential that he partici-
pate in athletic events, monitor industry trends in 
the field, and meet directly with dealers and cus-
tomers. Jackson’s strong customer focus has helped 
the company expand successfully worldwide, with 
distributors on six continents. With the iPhone and 
iPad, Jackson claims he can run the entire 120-per-
son company from afar. 
Jackson’s Wi-Fi-equipped RV connects wirelessly 
to the company headquarters in Sparta, T ennessee. 
When Jackson’s not on Wi-Fi, he uses his iPad 3G cel-
lular connection. The iPad gives him instant access 
to his entire operation, so he can analyze  customer 
data, refresh Web site content, or approve new 
designs. Jackson’s iPad includes calendars, e-mail, 
contact management, and the ability to  create and 
edit documents, spreadsheets, and presentations—all 
the tools this executive needs to communicate with 
the home office, dealers, and customers. 
Back at the shop, Jackson Kayak’s managers and 
employees find iPad and iPhone equally invaluable. 
In the factory, Chief Operations Officer John Ratliff 
can compare Jackson Kayak’s manufacturing equip-
ment side-by-side with images of replacement parts 
on the iPad to make sure he’s getting the correct 
pieces. The iPhone and iPad have become so indis-
pensable that the company outfitted its entire work-
force, from customer service, to design, to quality 
control, with iPhones. Many have iPads as well.
Using handhelds to run the business is not lim-
ited to small companies. General Electric (GE) is 
one of the world’s largest companies, producing 
aircraft engines, locomotives and other transporta-
tion equipment, kitchen and laundry appliances, 
lighting, electric distribution and control equip-
ment, generators and turbines, and medical imag-
ing equipment. GE is also a leading provider of 
financial services, aviation, clean energy, media, 
and health care technology. This giant multina-
tional was an early adopter of mobile technology. 
GE employees use their iPads to access e-mail, 
contacts, documents, and electronic presentations. 
GE’s Mobile Center of Excellence has developed 
dozens of iPhone and iPad applications, including 
industry-specific diagnostic and monitoring tools 
and  business intelligence tools that help decision 
makers find patterns and trends in large volumes 
of data. The company’s Transformer Monitoring 
app helps manage gas turbine inventory and 
 electronic transformers throughout the world, 
with the  ability to zoom in from a global map to a 
specific  transformer and read all of the key perfor-
mance indicators. A PDS Movement Planner lets 
service personnel monitor railway tracks and obtain 
 diagnostic information on locomotives.
With operations in 60 countries, Dow Corning 
offers more than 7,000 products and services 
for consumer and industrial applications, from 
 adhesives to lubricants, delivered as fluids,  solids, 
gels, and powders. The Roambi Visualizer app 
lets Dow Corning executives use their iPhones 
to quickly view and analyze real-time data from 
their core corporate system, including sales fig-
ures, trends, and projections. It presents managers 
with simple, intuitive dashboards of complex data. 
According to Executive Vice President and Chief 
Financial Officer Don Sheets, in 15 seconds he can 
get a sense of whether there’s a financial perfor-
mance issue he needs to get involved with.
Dow Corning’s Analytics App for the iPhone 
monitors Web site traffic and online sales for the 
company’s XIAMETER brand of standard silicone 
products. Analytics App interfaces with Google 
Analytics. When Dow Corning rolls out XIAMETER 
Web sites across the globe, executives can monitor

producers. But manufacturing is now a very small part of U.S. employment 
(less than 12  percent and declining). In a normal year, about 300,000 service 
jobs move  offshore to lower wage countries. Many of the jobs are in  less-skilled 
information system occupations, but some are “tradable service” jobs in 
 architecture, financial services, customer call centers, consulting, engineering, 
and even radiology.
On the plus side, the U.S. economy  creates over 3.5 million new jobs in 
a normal, non-recessionary year. However, only 1.1 million private sector 
jobs were created due to slow recovery in 2011. Employment in information 
 systems and the other service occupations is expanding, and wages are stable. 
Outsourcing has actually accelerated the development of new systems in the 
United States and worldwide.
The challenge for you as a business student is to develop high-level skills 
through education and on-the-job experience that cannot be outsourced. The 
challenge for your business is to avoid markets for goods and services that can 
be produced offshore much less expensively. The opportunities are equally 
immense. Throughout this book, you will find examples of companies and 
 individuals who either failed or succeeded in using information systems to 
adapt to this new global environment.
What does globalization have to do with management information  systems? 
That’s simple: everything. The emergence of the Internet into a full-blown 
international communications system has drastically reduced the costs 
of operating and transacting on a global scale. Communication between 
a  factory floor in Shanghai and a distribution center in Rapid Falls, South 
Dakota, is now instant and virtually free. Customers can now shop in a world-
wide  marketplace, obtaining price and quality information reliably 24 hours a 
day. Firms producing goods and services on a global scale achieve extraordi-
nary cost reductions by finding low-cost suppliers and managing production 
facilities in other countries. Internet service firms, such as Google and eBay, 
are able to replicate their business models and services in multiple countries 
without having to redesign their expensive fixed-cost information systems 
infrastructure. Half of the revenue of eBay (as well as General Motors) in 2011 
will originate outside the United States. Briefly, information systems enable 
globalization.
THE EMERGING DIGITAL FIRM
All of the changes we have just described, coupled with equally significant 
 organizational redesign, have created the conditions for a fully digital firm. A 
digital firm can be defined along several dimensions. A digital firm is one 
in which nearly all of the organization’s significant business relationships  with 
 customers, suppliers, and employees are digitally enabled and mediated. Core 
business  processes are accomplished through digital networks spanning the 
entire organization or linking multiple organizations.
Business processes refer to the set of logically related tasks and  behaviors 
that organizations develop over time to produce specific business results and 
the unique manner in which these activities are organized and coordinated. 
Developing a new product, generating and fulfilling an order, creating a 
 marketing plan, and hiring an employee are examples of business processes, 
and the ways organizations accomplish their business processes can be a source 
of competitive strength. (A detailed discussion of business processes can be 
found in Chapter 2.)

Key corporate assets—intellectual property, core competencies, and financial 
and human assets—are managed through digital means. In a digital firm, any 
piece of information required to support key business decisions is available at 
any time and anywhere in the firm.
Digital firms sense and respond to their environments far more rapidly than 
traditional firms, giving them more flexibility to survive in turbulent times. 
Digital firms offer extraordinary opportunities for more flexible global organiza-
tion and management. In digital firms, both time shifting and space shifting are 
the norm. Time shifting refers to business being conducted continuously, 24/7, 
rather than in narrow “work day” time bands of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Space shifting 
means that work takes place in a global workshop, as well as within national 
boundaries. Work is accomplished physically wherever in the world it is best 
accomplished.
Many firms, such as Cisco Systems, 3M, and IBM, are close to becoming 
 digital firms, using the Internet to drive every aspect of their business. Most 
other companies are not fully digital, but they are moving toward close digital 
integration with suppliers, customers, and employees. Many firms, for  example, 
are replacing traditional face-to-face meetings with “virtual” meetings using 
 videoconferencing and Web conferencing technology. (See Chapter 2.)
STRATEGIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES OF INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS
What makes information systems so essential today? Why are businesses 
 investing so much in information systems and technologies? In the United 
States, more than 21 million managers and 154 million workers in the labor 
force rely on information systems to conduct business. Information systems 
are essential for conducting day-to-day business in the United States and most 
other advanced countries, as well as achieving strategic business objectives.
Entire sectors of the economy are nearly inconceivable without substantial 
investments in information systems. E-commerce firms such as Amazon, eBay, 
Google, and E*Trade simply would not exist. T oday’s service industries—
finance, insurance, and real estate, as well as personal services such as travel, 
medicine, and education—could not operate without information systems. 
Similarly, retail firms such as Walmart and Sears and manufacturing firms such 
as General Motors and General Electric require information systems to survive 
and prosper. Just as offices, telephones, filing cabinets, and efficient tall build-
ings with elevators were once the foundations of business in the twentieth 
 century, information technology is a foundation for business in the twenty-first 
century.
There is a growing interdependence between a firm’s ability to use informa-
tion technology and its ability to implement corporate strategies and achieve 
 corporate goals (see Figure 1.2). What a business would like to do in five years 
often depends on what its systems will be able to do. Increasing market share, 
becoming the high-quality or low-cost producer, developing new products, and 
increasing employee productivity depend more and more on the kinds and 
 quality of information systems in the organization. The more you understand 
about this relationship, the more valuable you will be as a manager.
Specifically, business firms invest heavily in information systems to achieve 
six strategic business objectives: operational excellence; new products, services, 
and business models; customer and supplier intimacy; improved decision 
 making; competitive advantage; and survival.

Operational Excellence
Businesses continuously seek to improve the efficiency of their operations in 
order to achieve higher profitability. Information systems and technologies are 
some of the most important tools available to managers for achieving higher 
levels of efficiency and productivity in business operations, especially when 
coupled with changes in business practices and management behavior.
Walmart, the largest retailer on earth, exemplifies the power of infor-
mation systems coupled with brilliant business practices and supportive 
 management to achieve world-class operational efficiency. In fiscal year 
2012, Walmart achieved $460 billion in sales—nearly one-tenth of retail sales 
in the United States—in large part because of its Retail Link system, which 
digitally links its suppliers to every one of Walmart’s stores. As soon as a 
customer purchases an item, the supplier monitoring the item knows to ship 
a replacement to the shelf. Walmart is the most efficient retail store in the 
industry, achieving sales of more than $28 per square foot, compared to its 
closest competitor, T arget, at $23 a square foot. Other retail firms producing 
less than $12 a square foot.
New Products, Services, and Business Models
Information systems and technologies are a major enabling tool for firms to 
create new products and services, as well as entirely new business models. 
A business model describes how a company produces, delivers, and sells a 
 product or service to create wealth.
T oday’s music industry is vastly different from the industry a decade ago. 
Apple Inc. transformed an old business model of music distribution based on 
vinyl records, tapes, and CDs into an online, legal distribution model based on its 
own iPod technology platform. Apple has prospered from a continuing stream of 
iPod innovations, including the iT unes music service, the iPad, and the iPhone.
FIGURE 1.2 THE INTERDEPENDENCE BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS AND 
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
In contemporary systems, there is a growing interdependence between a firm’s information systems 
and its business capabilities. Changes in strategy, rules, and business processes increasingly require 
changes in hardware, software, databases, and telecommunications. Often, what the organization 
would like to do depends on what its systems will permit it to do.

Customer and Supplier Intimacy
When a business really knows its customers, and serves them well, the custom-
ers generally respond by returning and purchasing more. This raises revenues 
and profits. Likewise with suppliers: the more a business engages its suppli-
ers, the better the suppliers can provide vital inputs. This lowers costs. How to 
really know your customers, or suppliers, is a central problem for businesses 
with millions of offline and online customers.
The Mandarin Oriental in Manhattan and other high-end hotels exemplify the 
use of information systems and technologies to achieve customer intimacy. These 
hotels use computers to keep track of guests’ preferences, such as their preferred 
room temperature, check-in time, frequently dialed telephone numbers, and tele-
vision programs, and store these data in a large data repository. Individual rooms 
in the hotels are networked to a central network server computer so that they can 
be remotely monitored or controlled. When a customer arrives at one of these 
hotels, the system automatically changes the room conditions, such as dimming 
the lights, setting the room temperature, or selecting appropriate music, based 
on the customer’s digital profile. The hotels also analyze their customer data to 
identify their best customers and to develop individualized marketing campaigns 
based on customers’ preferences.
JCPenney exemplifies the benefits of information systems-enabled supplier 
intimacy. Every time a dress shirt is bought at a JCPenney store in the United 
States, the record of the sale appears immediately on computers in Hong Kong at 
the TAL Apparel Ltd. supplier, a contract manufacturer that produces one in eight 
dress shirts sold in the United States. TAL runs the numbers through a computer 
model it developed and then decides how many replacement shirts to make, and 
in what styles, colors, and sizes. TAL then sends the shirts to each JCPenney store, 
bypassing completely the retailer’s warehouses. In other words, JCPenney’s shirt 
inventory is near zero, as is the cost of storing it.
Improved Decision Making
Many business managers operate in an information fog bank, never really 
having the right information at the right time to make an informed decision. 
Instead, managers rely on forecasts, best guesses, and luck. The result is over- 
or underproduction of goods and services, misallocation of resources, and poor 
response times. These poor outcomes raise costs and lose customers. In the 
past decade, information systems and technologies have made it possible for 
managers to use real-time data from the marketplace when making decisions.
For instance, Verizon Corporation, one of the largest telecommunication 
companies in the United States, uses a Web-based digital dashboard to provide 
managers with precise real-time information on customer complaints, network 
performance for each locality served, and line outages or storm-damaged lines. 
Using this information, managers can immediately allocate repair resources 
to affected areas, inform consumers of repair efforts, and restore service fast.
Competitive Advantage
When firms achieve one or more of these business objectives—operational 
excellence; new products, services, and business models; customer/supplier 
intimacy; and improved decision making—chances are they have already 
achieved a competitive advantage. Doing things better than your competitors, 
charging less for superior products, and responding to customers and suppliers 
in real time all add up to higher sales and higher profits that your competitors 
cannot match. Apple Inc., Walmart, and UPS, described later in this chapter, are

industry leaders because they know how to use information systems for this 
purpose.
Survival
Business firms also invest in information systems and technologies because 
they are necessities of doing business. Sometimes these “necessities” are driven 
by industry-level changes. For instance, after Citibank introduced the first 
 automated teller machines (ATMs) in the New York region in 1977 to attract 
customers through higher service levels, its competitors rushed to provide ATMs 
to their customers to keep up with Citibank. T oday, virtually all banks in the 
United States have regional ATMs and link to national and international ATM 
networks, such as CIRRUS. Providing ATM services to retail banking customers 
is simply a requirement of being in and surviving in the retail banking business.
There are many federal and state statutes and regulations that create a legal 
duty for companies and their employees to retain records, including digital 
records. For instance, the T oxic Substances Control Act (1976), which regulates 
the exposure of U.S. workers to more than 75,000 toxic chemicals, requires 
firms to retain records on employee exposure for 30 years. The Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act (2002), which was intended to improve the accountability of public firms 
and their auditors, requires certified public accounting firms that audit public 
 companies to retain audit working papers and records, including all e-mails, 
for five years. Many other pieces of federal and state legislation in health 
care, financial services, education, and privacy protection impose significant 
 information retention and reporting requirements on U.S. businesses. Firms 
turn to information systems and technologies to provide the capability to 
respond to these challenges.
1.2  PERSPECTIVES ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
So far we’ve used information systems  and technologies  informally without 
 defining the terms. Information technology (IT) consists of all the hard-
ware and software that a firm needs to use in order to achieve its business 
 objectives. This includes not only computer machines, storage devices, and 
handheld mobile devices, but also software, such as the Windows or Linux 
 operating  systems, the Microsoft Office desktop productivity suite, and the 
many thousands of computer programs that can be found in a typical large 
firm. “Information systems” are more complex and can be best be understood 
by looking at them from both a technology and a business perspective.
WHAT IS AN INFORMATION SYSTEM?
An information system can be defined technically as a set of interrelated 
components that collect (or retrieve), process, store, and distribute information 
to support decision making and control in an organization. In addition to sup-
porting decision making, coordination, and control, information systems may 
also help managers and workers analyze problems, visualize complex subjects, 
and create new products.
Information systems contain information about significant people, places, 
and things within the organization or in the environment surrounding it. 
By information we mean data that have been shaped into a form that is 
 meaningful and useful to human beings. Data, in contrast, are streams of raw 
 Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 45
```

## Page 15
```
facts representing events occurring in organizations or the physical environ-
ment before they have been organized and arranged into a form that people can 
understand and use.
A brief example contrasting information and data may prove useful. 
Supermarket checkout counters scan millions of pieces of data from bar 
codes, which describe each product. Such pieces of data can be totaled and 
analyzed to provide meaningful information, such as the total number of 
bottles of dish detergent sold at a particular store, which brands of dish deter-
gent were selling the most rapidly at that store or sales territory, or the total 
amount spent on that brand of dish detergent at that store or sales region 
(see Figure 1.3).
Three activities in an information system produce the information that 
organizations need to make decisions, control operations, analyze problems, 
and create new products or services. These activities are input, processing, 
and output (see Figure 1.4). Input captures or collects raw data from within 
the organization or from its external environment. Processing converts this 
raw input into a meaningful form. Output transfers the processed informa-
tion to the people who will use it or to the activities for which it will be used. 
Information systems also require feedback, which is output that is returned to 
appropriate members of the organization to help them evaluate or correct the 
input stage.
For example, in Disney World’s systems for controlling crowds, the raw input 
consists of data from airline bookings and hotel reservations, satellite weather 
data, historic attendance data for the date being analyzed, and images of crowds 
from video cameras stationed at key locations throughout the park.  Computers 
store these data and process them to calculate projected total attendance for 
a specific date as well as attendance figures and wait times for each ride and 
restaurant at various times during the day. The systems indicate which rides or 
attractions are too overcrowded, which have spare capacity, and which can add 
capacity. The system provides meaningful information such as the number of 
      FIGURE 1.3  DATA AND INFORMATION 
Raw data from a supermarket checkout counter can be processed and organized to produce meaningful information, such 
as the total unit sales of dish detergent or the total sales revenue from dish detergent for a specific store or sales territory.

guests attending on a particular day or time period, the average wait time per 
ride, the average number of restaurant and shop visits, the average number of 
rides guests squeezed into a single day’s visit, and the average amount spent 
per  customer during a specific time period. Such information helps Disney 
 management gauge the theme park’s overall efficiency and profitability. 
Although computer-based information systems use computer technology 
to process raw data into meaningful information, there is a sharp distinc-
tion between a computer and a computer program on the one hand, and an 
information system on the other. Electronic computers and related software 
programs are the technical foundation, the tools and materials, of modern 
information systems. Computers provide the equipment for storing and 
 processing information. Computer programs, or software, are sets of operat-
ing instructions that direct and control computer processing. Knowing how 
computers and computer programs work is important in designing solutions 
to organizational problems, but computers are only part of an information 
system.
A house is an appropriate analogy. Houses are built with hammers, nails, and 
wood, but these do not make a house. The architecture, design, setting, land-
scaping, and all of the decisions that lead to the creation of these features are 
part of the house and are crucial for solving the problem of putting a roof over 
one’s head. Computers and programs are the hammers, nails, and lumber of 
computer-based information systems, but alone they cannot produce the infor-
mation a particular organization needs. T o understand information systems, 
   FIGURE 1.4 FUNCTIONS OF AN INFORMATION SYSTEM
An information system contains information about an organization and its surrounding environment. 
Three basic activities—input, processing, and output—produce the information organizations need. 
Feedback is output returned to appropriate people or activities in the organization to evaluate and 
refine the input. Environmental actors, such as customers, suppliers, competitors, stockholders, and 
regulatory agencies, interact with the organization and its information systems.

you must understand the problems they are designed to solve, their architec-
tural and design elements, and the organizational processes that lead to these 
solutions.
DIMENSIONS OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS
T o fully understand information systems, you must understand the broader 
organization, management, and information technology dimensions 
of  systems (see Figure 1.5) and their power to provide solutions to chal-
lenges and problems in the business environment. We refer to this broader 
understanding of information systems, which encompasses an understand-
ing of the management and organizational dimensions of systems as well 
as the technical dimensions of systems, as information systems liter-
acy. Computer literacy, in contrast, focuses primarily on knowledge of 
 information technology.
The field of management information systems (MIS) tries to achieve this 
broader information systems literacy. MIS deals with behavioral issues as well 
as technical issues surrounding the development, use, and impact of informa-
tion systems used by managers and employees in the firm.
Let’s examine each of the dimensions of information systems—organizations, 
management, and information technology.
Organizations
Information systems are an integral part of organizations. Indeed, for some 
companies, such as credit reporting firms, there would be no business without 
an information system. The key elements of an organization are its people, 
structure, business processes, politics, and culture. We introduce these compo-
nents of organizations here and describe them in greater detail in Chapters 2 
and 3.
   FIGURE 1.5  INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE MORE THAN COMPUTERS
Using information systems effectively requires an understanding of the organization, management, 
and information technology shaping the systems. An information system creates value for the firm as 
an organizational and management solution to challenges posed by the environment.

Organizations have a structure that is composed of different levels and 
 specialties. Their structures reveal a clear-cut division of labor. Authority and 
responsibility in a business firm are organized as a hierarchy, or a pyramid 
structure. The upper levels of the hierarchy consist of managerial, professional, 
and technical employees, whereas the lower levels consist of operational 
personnel.
Senior management makes long-range strategic decisions about products 
and services as well as ensures financial performance of the firm. Middle 
management carries out the programs and plans of senior management, 
and operational management is responsible for monitoring the daily activi-
ties of the business. Knowledge workers , such as engineers, scientists, or 
 architects, design products or services and create new knowledge for the firm, 
whereas data workers, such as secretaries or clerks, assist with scheduling 
and  communications at all levels of the firm. Production or service workers 
 actually produce the product and deliver the service (see Figure 1.6).
Experts are employed and trained for different business functions. The major 
business functions, or specialized tasks performed by business organizations, 
consist of sales and marketing, manufacturing and production, finance and 
accounting, and human resources (see T able 1.2). Chapter 2 provides more 
detail on these business functions and the ways in which they are supported by 
information systems.
An organization coordinates work through its hierarchy and through its 
business processes, which are logically related tasks and behaviors for accom-
plishing work. Developing a new product, fulfilling an order, and hiring a new 
employee are examples of business processes.
Most organizations’ business processes include formal rules that have been 
developed over a long time for accomplishing tasks. These rules guide employ-
ees in a variety of procedures, from writing an invoice to responding to customer 
complaints. Some of these business processes have been written down, but others 
   FIGURE 1.6  LEVELS IN A FIRM
Business organizations are hierarchies consisting of three principal levels: senior management, middle 
management, and operational management. Information systems serve each of these levels. Scientists 
and knowledge workers often work with middle management.

are informal work practices, such as a requirement to return telephone calls from 
coworkers or customers, that are not formally documented. Information systems 
automate many business processes. For instance, how a customer receives credit 
or how a customer is billed is often determined by an information system that 
incorporates a set of formal business processes.
Each organization has a unique culture, or fundamental set of assumptions, 
values, and ways of doing things, that has been accepted by most of its  members. 
You can see organizational culture at work by looking around your university or 
college. Some bedrock assumptions of university life are that professors know 
more than students, the reasons students attend college is to learn, and that 
classes follow a regular schedule.
Parts of an organization’s culture can always be found embedded in its 
 information systems. For instance, UPS’s first priority is customer service, which 
is an aspect of its organizational culture that can be found in the  company’s 
package tracking systems, which we describe later in this section.
Different levels and specialties in an organization create different interests 
and points of view. These views often conflict over how the company should 
be run and how resources and rewards should be distributed. Conflict is the 
basis for organizational politics. Information systems come out of this  cauldron 
of differing perspectives, conflicts, compromises, and agreements that are a 
 natural part of all organizations. In Chapter 3, we examine these features of 
organizations and their role in the development of information systems in 
greater detail.
Management
Management’s job is to make sense out of the many situations faced by 
 organizations, make decisions, and formulate action plans to solve organiza-
tional problems. Managers perceive business challenges in the environment; 
they set the organizational strategy for responding to those challenges; and 
they allocate the human and financial resources to coordinate the work and 
achieve success. Throughout, they must exercise responsible leadership. The 
business information systems described in this book reflect the hopes, dreams, 
and  realities of real-world managers.
But managers must do more than manage what already exists. They must 
also create new products and services and even re-create the organization from 
time to time. A substantial part of management responsibility is creative work 
driven by new knowledge and information. Information technology can play a 
powerful role in helping managers design and deliver new products and  services 
and redirecting and redesigning their organizations. Chapter 12 treats manage-
ment decision making in detail.

Information Technology
Information technology is one of many tools managers use to cope with change. 
Computer hardware is the physical equipment used for input, processing, and 
output activities in an information system. It consists of the following: comput-
ers of various sizes and shapes (including mobile handheld devices); various 
input, output, and storage devices; and telecommunications devices that link 
computers together.
Computer software consists of the detailed, preprogrammed instructions 
that control and coordinate the computer hardware components in an informa-
tion system. Chapter 5 describes the contemporary software and hardware 
 platforms used by firms today in greater detail.
Data management technolog y consists of the software governing the 
 organization of data on physical storage media. More detail on data organization 
and access methods can be found in Chapter 6.
Networking and telecommunications technology , consisting of both 
physical devices and software, links the various pieces of hardware and transfers 
data from one physical location to another. Computers and communications 
equipment can be connected in networks for sharing voice, data, images, sound, 
and video. A network links two or more computers to share data or resources, 
such as a printer.
The world’s largest and most widely used network is the Internet. The 
Internet is a global “network of networks” that uses universal standards 
(described in Chapter 7) to connect millions of different networks with nearly 
2.3 billion users in over 230 countries around the world.
The Internet has created a new “universal” technology platform on which to 
build new products, services, strategies, and business models. This same 
 technology platform has internal uses, providing the connectivity to link differ-
ent systems and networks within the firm. Internal corporate networks based 
on Internet technology are called intranets. Private intranets extended to 
authorized users outside the organization are called extranets, and firms use 
such networks to coordinate their activities with other firms for making 
 purchases, collaborating on design, and other interorganizational work. For 
most business firms today, using Internet technology is both a business 
 necessity and a competitive advantage.
The World Wide Web is a service provided by the Internet that uses univer-
sally accepted standards for storing, retrieving, formatting, and displaying infor-
mation in a page format on the Internet. Web pages contain text, graphics, ani-
mations, sound, and video and are linked to other Web pages. By clicking on 
highlighted words or buttons on a Web page, you can link to related pages to find 
additional information and links to other locations on the Web. The Web can 
serve as the foundation for new kinds of information systems such as UPS’s Web-
based package tracking system described in the following Interactive Session.
All of these technologies, along with the people required to run and man-
age them, represent resources that can be shared throughout the organiza-
tion and constitute the firm’s information technology (IT) infrastruc-
ture. The IT infrastructure provides the foundation, or platform, on which 
the firm can build its specific information systems. Each organization must 
carefully design and manage its IT infrastructure so that it has the set of 
technology services it needs for the work it wants to accomplish with infor-
mation systems. Chapters 5 through 8 of this book examine each major tech-
nology component of information technology infrastructure and show how 
they all work together to create the technology platform for the organization.
 Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 51

The Interactive Session on T echnology describes some of the typical tech-
nologies used in computer-based information systems today. UPS invests heav-
ily in information systems technology to make its business more efficient and 
customer oriented. It uses an array of information technologies, including bar 
code scanning systems, wireless networks, large mainframe computers, hand-
held computers, the Internet, and many different pieces of software for track-
ing packages, calculating fees, maintaining customer accounts, and managing 
logistics.
Let’s identify the organization, management, and technology elements in 
the UPS package tracking system we have just described. The organization 
 element anchors the package tracking system in UPS’s sales and production 
functions (the main product of UPS is a service—package delivery). It speci-
fies the required procedures for identifying packages with both sender and 
recipient information, taking inventory, tracking the packages en route, and 
providing package status reports for UPS customers and customer service 
representatives.
The system must also provide information to satisfy the needs of managers 
and workers. UPS drivers need to be trained in both package pickup and deliv-
ery procedures and in how to use the package tracking system so that they can 
work efficiently and effectively. UPS customers may need some training to use 
UPS in-house package tracking software or the UPS Web site.
UPS’s management is responsible for monitoring service levels and costs 
and for promoting the company’s strategy of combining low cost and superior 
 service. Management decided to use computer systems to increase the ease 
of sending a package using UPS and of checking its delivery status, thereby 
 reducing delivery costs and increasing sales revenues.
The technology supporting this system consists of handheld computers, bar 
code scanners, desktop computers, wired and wireless communications  networks, 
UPS’s data center, storage technology for the package delivery data, UPS in-house 
package tracking software, and software to access the World Wide Web. The result 
is an information system solution to the business challenge of providing a high 
level of service with low prices in the face of mounting competition.
IT ISN’T JUST TECHNOLOGY: A BUSINESS 
PERSPECTIVE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS
Managers and business firms invest in information technology and systems 
because they provide real economic value to the business. The decision to build 
or maintain an information system assumes that the returns on this invest-
ment will be superior to other investments in buildings, machines, or other 
assets. These superior returns will be expressed as increases in productivity, 
as increases in revenues (which will increase the firm’s stock market value), 
or perhaps as superior long-term strategic positioning of the firm in certain 
 markets (which produce superior revenues in the future).
We can see that from a business perspective, an information system is an 
important instrument for creating value for the firm. Information  systems 
enable the firm to increase its revenue or decrease its costs by providing 
 information that helps managers make better decisions or that improves the 
execution of business processes. For example, the information system for 
 analyzing supermarket checkout data illustrated in Figure 1.3 on page 46 can 
increase firm profitability by helping managers make better decisions as to 
which products to stock and promote in retail supermarkets.

United Parcel Service (UPS) started out in 1907 in a 
closet-sized basement office. Jim Casey and Claude 
Ryan—two teenagers from Seattle with two bicycles 
and one phone—promised the “best service and 
 lowest rates.” UPS has used this formula success-
fully for more than a century to become the world’s 
largest ground and air package-delivery company. 
It’s a global enterprise with over 400,000 employees, 
93,000 vehicles, and the world’s ninth largest airline.
UPS delivers 15.6 million packages and documents 
each day in the United States and more than 220 
other countries and territories. The firm has been 
able to maintain leadership in small-package delivery 
services despite stiff competition from FedEx and 
Airborne Express by investing heavily in advanced 
information technology. UPS spends more than $1 
billion each year to maintain a high level of customer 
service while keeping costs low and streamlining its 
overall operations.
It all starts with the scannable bar-coded label 
attached to a package, which contains detailed 
 information about the sender, the destination, and 
when the package should arrive. Customers can 
download and print their own labels using special 
software provided by UPS or by accessing the UPS 
Web site. Before the package is even picked up, infor-
mation from the “smart” label is transmitted to one 
of UPS’s computer centers in Mahwah, New Jersey, 
or Alpharetta, Georgia, and sent to the distribution 
center nearest its final destination. 
Dispatchers at this center download the label data 
and use special software to create the most efficient 
delivery route for each driver that considers traffic, 
weather conditions, and the location of each stop. 
UPS estimates its delivery trucks save 28 million 
miles and burn 3 million fewer gallons of fuel each 
year as a result of using this technology. T o further 
increase cost savings and safety, drivers are trained 
to use “340 Methods” developed by industrial engi-
neers to optimize the performance of every task from 
lifting and loading boxes to selecting a package from 
a shelf in the truck.
The first thing a UPS driver picks up each day is 
a handheld computer called a Delivery Information 
Acquisition Device (DIAD), which can access a wire-
less cell phone network. As soon as the driver logs 
on, his or her day’s route is downloaded onto the 
handheld. The DIAD also automatically captures 
INTERACTIVE SESSION: TECHNOLOGY
UPS COMPETES GLOBALLY WITH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
customers’ signatures along with pickup and delivery 
information. Package tracking information is then 
transmitted to UPS’s computer network for storage 
and processing. From there, the information can 
be accessed worldwide to provide proof of delivery 
to customers or to respond to customer queries. It 
 usually takes less than 60 seconds from the time a 
driver presses “complete” on the DIAD for the new 
information to be available on the Web.
Through its automated package tracking  system, 
UPS can monitor and even re-route  packages 
throughout the delivery process. At various points 
along the route from sender to receiver, bar 
code devices scan shipping information on the 
 package label and feed data about the progress of 
the  package into the central computer. Customer 
 service  representatives are able to check the status 
of any package from desktop computers linked to 
the  central computers and respond immediately to 
 inquiries from customers. UPS customers can also 
access this information from the company’s Web 
site using their own computers or mobile phones. 
UPS now has mobile apps and a mobile Web site for 
iPhone, BlackBerry, and Android smartphone users. 
Anyone with a package to ship can access the UPS 
Web site to track packages, check delivery routes, 
 calculate shipping rates, determine time in transit, 
print labels, and schedule a pickup. The data col-
lected at the UPS Web site are transmitted to the UPS 
central computer and then back to the customer 
after processing. UPS also provides tools that enable 
customers, such Cisco Systems, to embed UPS func-
tions, such as tracking and cost calculations, into 
their own Web sites so that they can track shipments 
without visiting the UPS site.
A Web-based Post Sales Order Management System 
(OMS) manages global service orders and inventory 
for critical parts fulfillment. The system enables high-
tech electronics, aerospace, medical equipment, and 
other companies anywhere in the world that ship crit-
ical parts to quickly assess their critical parts inven-
tory, determine the most optimal routing strategy to 
meet customer needs, place orders online, and track 
parts from the warehouse to the end user. An auto-
mated e-mail or fax feature keeps customers informed 
of each shipping milestone and can provide notifica-
tion of any changes to flight schedules for commercial 
airlines carrying their parts.

CASE STUDY QUESTIONS
1. What are the inputs, processing, and outputs of 
UPS’s package tracking system? 
2. What technologies are used by UPS? How are these 
technologies related to UPS’s business strategy? 
UPS is now leveraging its decades of expertise 
managing its own global delivery network to manage 
logistics and supply chain activities for other compa-
nies. It created a UPS Supply Chain Solutions division 
that provides a complete bundle of standardized ser-
vices to subscribing companies at a fraction of what it 
would cost to build their own systems and infrastruc-
ture. These services include supply chain design and 
management, freight forwarding, customs brokerage, 
mail services, multimodal transportation, and finan-
cial services, in addition to logistics services. 
In 2006, UPS started running the supply chains of 
medical device and pharmaceutical companies. For 
example, at UPS headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, 
company pharmacists fill 4,000 orders a day for 
insulin pumps and other supplies from customers 
of Medtronic Inc., the Minneapolis-based medical-
device company. UPS pharmacists in Louisville log 
into Medtronic's system, fill the orders with devices 
stocked on site, and arrange for UPS to ship them 
to patients. UPS's service has allowed Medtronic to 
close its own distribution warehouse and significantly 
reduce the costs of processing each order. UPS and 
other parcel delivery companies are investing in giant 
warehouses that service multiple pharmaceutical 
companies at once, with freezers for medicines and 
high-security vaults for controlled substances. 
UPS has partnered with Pratt & Whitney, a world 
leader in the design, manufacture, and  service 
of  aircraft engines, space propulsion  systems, 
and industrial gas turbines, to run its Georgia 
Distribution Center, which processes 98 percent 
of the parts used to overhaul Pratt & Whitney jet 
engines for shipment around the world. UPS and 
Pratt & Whitney employees together keep track of 
about 25,000 different kinds of parts and fulfill up to 
1,400 complex orders each day—ranging from a few 
nuts and bolts to kits comprising all the parts needed 
to build an entire engine. On the receiving side of 
the 250,000-square-foot building, UPS quality inspec-
tors check newly arrived parts against blueprints.

3. What strategic business objectives do UPS’s 
 information systems address? 
4.  What would happen if UPS’s information systems 
were not available?
Using a handheld computer 
called a Delivery Information 
Acquisition Device (DIAD), UPS 
drivers automatically capture 
customers’ signatures along with 
pickup, delivery, and time card 
information. UPS information 
systems use these data to track 
packages while they are being 
transported.

Every business has an information value chain, illustrated in Figure 1.7, in 
which raw information is systematically acquired and then transformed through 
various stages that add value to that information. The value of an information 
system to a business, as well as the decision to invest in any new information 
system, is, in large part, determined by the extent to which the system will lead 
to better management decisions, more efficient business processes, and higher 
firm profitability. Although there are other reasons why systems are built, their 
primary purpose is to contribute to corporate value.
From a business perspective, information systems are part of a series of 
value-adding activities for acquiring, transforming, and distributing informa-
tion that managers can use to improve decision making, enhance organiza-
tional performance, and, ultimately, increase firm profitability.
The business perspective calls attention to the organizational and managerial 
nature of information systems. An information system represents an organiza-
tional and management solution, based on information technology, to a chal-
lenge or problem posed by the environment. Every chapter in this book begins 
with a short case study that illustrates this concept. A diagram at the beginning 
of each chapter illustrates the relationship between a business challenge and 
resulting management and organizational decisions to use IT as a solution to 
challenges generated by the business environment. You can use this diagram 
as a starting point for analyzing any information system or information system 
problem you encounter.
Review the diagram at the beginning of this chapter. The diagram shows how 
the Ponsse wood production firm systems solved the business problem pre-
sented by the need to integrate its production and manufacturing processes.

These systems provide a solution that takes advantage of new interactive digital 
technology and opportunities created by a host of technologies such as GPS. 
The firm developed new ways to coordinate production, manufacturing, and 
sales. The diagram also illustrates how management, technology, and organiza-
tional elements work together to create system solutions.
COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS: ORGANIZATIONAL 
CAPITAL AND THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL
Awareness of the organizational and managerial dimensions of information sys-
tems can help us understand why some firms achieve better results from their 
information systems than others. Studies of returns from information technol-
ogy investments show that there is considerable variation in the returns firms 
receive (see Figure 1.8). Some firms invest a great deal and receive a great deal 
(quadrant 2); others invest an equal amount and receive few returns (quadrant 
4). Still other firms invest little and receive much (quadrant 1), whereas others 
invest little and receive little (quadrant 3). This suggests that investing in infor-
mation technology does not by itself guarantee good returns. What accounts for 
this variation among firms?
The answer lies in the concept of complementary assets. Information 
 technology investments alone cannot make organizations and managers more 
effective unless they are accompanied by supportive values, structures, and 
behavior patterns in the organization and other complementary assets. Business 
firms need to change how they do business before they can really reap the 
advantages of new information technologies.
Some firms fail to adopt the right business model that suits the new 
 technology, or seek to preserve an old business model that is doomed by new 
technology. For instance, recording label companies refused to change their 
   FIGURE 1.8 VARIATION IN RETURNS ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
INVESTMENT
Although, on average, investments in information technology produce returns far above those returned 
by other investments, there is considerable variation across firms.

old business model, which was based on physical music stores for distribu-
tion rather than adopt a new online distribution model. As a result, online 
legal music sales are dominated not by record companies but by a technology 
 company called Apple Computer.
Complementary assets are those assets required to derive value from 
a  primary investment (T eece, 1988). For instance, to realize value from 
 automobiles requires substantial complementary investments in highways, 
roads,  gasoline stations, repair facilities, and a legal regulatory structure to set 
standards and control drivers.
Research indicates that firms that support their technology investments 
with investments in complementary assets, such as new business models, 
new business processes, management behavior, organizational culture, or 
training, receive superior returns, whereas those firms failing to make these 
complementary investments receive less or no returns on their information 
technology investments (Brynjolfsson, 2003; Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2000; 
Davern and Kauffman, 2000; Laudon, 1974). These investments in organiza-
tion and management are also known as organizational and management 
capital.
T able 1.3 lists the major complementary investments that firms need to 
make to realize value from their information technology investments. Some 
of this investment involves tangible assets, such as buildings, machinery, 
and tools. However, the value of investments in information technology 
depends to a large extent on complementary investments in management 
and organization.
Key organizational complementary investments are a supportive business 
culture that values efficiency and effectiveness, an appropriate business model, 
efficient business processes, decentralization of authority, highly distributed 
decision rights, and a strong information system (IS) development team.

Important managerial complementary assets are strong senior management 
support for change, incentive systems that monitor and reward individual 
 innovation, an emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, training programs, 
and a management culture that values flexibility and knowledge.
Important social investments (not made by the firm but by the society at 
large, other firms, governments, and other key market actors) are the Internet 
and the supporting Internet culture, educational systems, network and comput-
ing standards, regulations and laws, and the presence of technology and service 
firms.
Throughout the book we emphasize a framework of analysis that considers 
technology, management, and organizational assets and their interactions. 
Perhaps the single most important theme in the book, reflected in case studies 
and exercises, is that managers need to consider the broader organization and 
management dimensions of information systems to understand current 
 problems as well as to derive substantial above-average returns from their infor-
mation technology investments. As you will see throughout the text, firms that 
can address these related dimensions of the IT investment are, on average, 
richly rewarded.
1.3 CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES TO INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS
The study of information systems is a multidisciplinary field. No single theory 
or perspective dominates. Figure 1.9 illustrates the major disciplines that con-
tribute problems, issues, and solutions in the study of information systems. 
In general, the field can be divided into technical and behavioral approaches. 
Information systems are sociotechnical systems. Though they are composed 
of machines, devices, and “hard” physical technology, they require substan-
tial social, organizational, and intellectual investments to make them work 
properly.
TECHNICAL APPROACH
The technical approach to information systems emphasizes mathematically 
based models to study information systems, as well as the physical technology 
and formal capabilities of these systems. The disciplines that contribute to the 
technical approach are computer science, management science, and operations 
research.
Computer science is concerned with establishing theories of computabil-
ity, methods of computation, and methods of efficient data storage and access. 
Management science emphasizes the development of models for decision-mak-
ing and management practices. Operations research focuses on mathematical 
techniques for optimizing selected parameters of organizations, such as trans-
portation, inventory control, and transaction costs.
BEHAVIORAL APPROACH
An important part of the information systems field is concerned with  behavioral 
issues that arise in the development and long-term maintenance of information 
systems. Issues such as strategic business integration, design, implementation, 
utilization, and management cannot be explored usefully with the models used 
58 Part One Organizations, Management, and the Networked Enterprise
```

## Page 28
```
in the technical approach. Other behavioral disciplines contribute important 
concepts and methods.
For instance, sociologists study information systems with an eye toward 
how groups and organizations shape the development of systems and also 
how  systems affect individuals, groups, and organizations. Psychologists study 
 information systems with an interest in how human decision makers perceive 
and use formal information. Economists study information systems with an 
interest in understanding the production of digital goods, the dynamics of 
 digital markets, and how new information systems change the control and cost 
structures within the firm.
The behavioral approach does not ignore technology. Indeed, information 
systems technology is often the stimulus for a behavioral problem or issue. But 
the focus of this approach is generally not on technical solutions. Instead, it 
concentrates on changes in attitudes, management and organizational policy, 
and behavior.
APPROACH OF THIS TEXT: SOCIOTECHNICAL SYSTEMS
Throughout this book you will find a rich story with four main actors:  suppliers of 
hardware and software (the technologists); business firms making  investments 
and seeking to obtain value from the technology; managers and employees 
seeking to achieve business value (and other goals); and the  contemporary 
legal, social, and cultural context (the firm’s environment). T ogether these 
actors produce what we call management information systems.
The study of management information systems (MIS)  arose to focus on 
the use of computer-based information systems in business firms and gov-
ernment agencies. MIS combines the work of computer science, manage-
ment science, and operations research with a practical orientation toward 
   FIGURE 1.9 CONTEMPORARY APPROACHES TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The study of information systems deals with issues and insights contributed from technical and 
behavioral disciplines.
 Chapter 1 Information Systems in Global Business Today 59

## Page 29
```
developing system solutions to real-world problems and managing informa-
tion technology resources. It is also concerned with behavioral issues sur-
rounding the development, use, and impact of information systems, which 
are typically discussed in the fields of sociology, economics, and psychology.
Our experience as academics and practitioners leads us to believe that no 
single approach effectively captures the reality of information systems. The 
successes and failures of information are rarely all technical or all behavioral. 
Our best advice to students is to understand the perspectives of many disci-
plines. Indeed, the challenge and excitement of the information systems field 
is that it requires an appreciation and tolerance of many different approaches.
The view we adopt in this book is best characterized as the sociotech-
nical view of systems. In this view, optimal organizational performance is 
achieved by jointly optimizing both the social and technical systems used in 
production.
Adopting a sociotechnical systems perspective helps to avoid a purely tech-
nological approach to information systems. For instance, the fact that infor-
mation technology is rapidly declining in cost and growing in power does not 
necessarily or easily translate into productivity enhancement or bottom-line 
profits. The fact that a firm has recently installed an enterprise-wide finan-
cial reporting system does not necessarily mean that it will be used, or used 
effectively. Likewise, the fact that a firm has recently introduced new business 
procedures and processes does not necessarily mean employees will be more 
productive in the absence of investments in new information systems to enable 
those processes.
In this book, we stress the need to optimize the firm’s performance as a 
whole. Both the technical and behavioral components need attention. This 
means that technology must be changed and designed in such a way as to 
fit organizational and individual needs. Sometimes, the technology may 
have to be “de-optimized” to accomplish this fit. For instance, mobile phone 
users adapt this technology to their personal needs, and as a result manufac-
turers quickly seek to adjust the technology to conform with user expecta-
tions. Organizations and individuals must also be changed through training, 
   FIGURE 1.10 A SOCIOTECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE ON INFORMATION 
SYSTEMS
In a sociotechnical perspective, the performance of a system is optimized when both the technology 
and the organization mutually adjust to one another until a satisfactory fit is obtained.

learning, and planned organizational change to allow the technology to 
 operate and prosper. Figure 1.10 illustrates this process of mutual adjustment 
in a sociotechnical system.

Review Summary
1. How are information systems transforming business, and what is their relationship to globalization?
E-mail, online conferencing, smartphones, and tablet computers have become essential tools for 
conducting business. Information systems are the foundation of fast-paced supply chains. The Internet 
allows many businesses to buy, sell, advertise, and solicit customer feedback online. Organizations are 
trying to become more competitive and efficient by digitally enabling their core business processes 
and evolving into digital firms. The Internet has stimulated globalization by dramatically reducing the 
costs of producing, buying, and selling goods on a global scale. New information system trends include 
the emerging mobile digital platform, online software as a service, and cloud computing.
2. Why are information systems so essential for running and managing a business today?
Information systems are a foundation for conducting business today. In many industries, survival 
and the ability to achieve strategic business goals are difficult without extensive use of information 
technology. Businesses today use information systems to achieve six major objectives: operational 
excellence; new products, services, and business models; customer/supplier intimacy; improved 
 decision making; competitive advantage; and day-to-day survival.
3. What exactly is an information system? How does it work? What are its management, organization, 
and technology components?
From a technical perspective, an information system collects, stores, and disseminates information 
from an organization’s environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and 
decision making, communication, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization. Information 
 systems transform raw data into useful information through three basic activities: input, processing, 
and output.
From a business perspective, an information system provides a solution to a problem or challenge 
facing a firm and represents a combination of management, organization, and technology elements. 
The management dimension of information systems involves issues such as leadership, strategy, and 
management behavior. The technology dimension consists of computer hardware, software, data 
 management technology, and networking/telecommunications technology (including the Internet). 
The organization dimension of information systems involves issues such as the organization’s 
 hierarchy, functional specialties, business processes, culture, and political interest groups.
4. What are complementary assets? Why are complementary assets essential for ensuring that  information 
systems provide genuine value for an organization?
In order to obtain meaningful value from information systems, organizations must support their 
technology investments with appropriate complementary investments in organizations and manage-
ment. These complementary assets include new business models and business processes, supportive 
organizational culture and management behavior, appropriate technology standards, regulations, and 
laws. New information technology investments are unlikely to produce high returns unless  businesses 
make the appropriate managerial and organizational changes to support the technology.
5. What academic disciplines are used to study information systems? How does each contribute to an 
understanding of information systems? What is a sociotechnical systems perspective?
The study of information systems deals with issues and insights contributed from technical and 
behavioral disciplines. The disciplines that contribute to the technical approach focusing on formal 
models and capabilities of systems are computer science, management science, and operations 
research. The disciplines contributing to the behavioral approach focusing on the design, implementa-
tion, management, and business impact of systems are psychology, sociology, and economics. A 
 sociotechnical view of systems considers both technical and social features of systems and solutions 
that represent the best fit between them.

Hands-On MIS Projects
The projects in this section give you hands-on experience in analyzing financial reporting and inventory 
management problems, using data management software to improve management decision making about 
increasing sales, and using Internet software for researching job requirements.
Management Decision Problems
1. Snyders of Hanover, which sells about 80 million bags of pretzels, snack chips, and organic snack items each 
year, had its financial department use spreadsheets and manual processes for much of its data gathering and 
reporting. Hanover’s financial analyst would spend the entire final week of every month collecting 
 spreadsheets from the heads of more than 50 departments worldwide. She would then consolidate and 
 re-enter all the data into another spreadsheet, which would serve as the company’s monthly profit-and-loss 
statement. If a department needed to update its data after submitting the spreadsheet to the main office, the 
analyst had to return the original spreadsheet, then wait for the department to re-submit its data before 
finally submitting the updated data in the consolidated document. Assess the impact of this situation on 
business performance and management decision making.
2. Dollar General Corporation operates deep-discount stores offering housewares, cleaning supplies, clothing, 
health and beauty aids, and packaged food, with most items selling for $1. Its business model calls for 
keeping costs as low as possible. The company has no automated method for keeping track of inventory at 
each store. Managers know approximately how many cases of a particular product the store is supposed to 
receive when a delivery truck arrives, but the stores lack technology for scanning the cases or verifying the 
item count inside the cases. Merchandise losses from theft or other mishaps have been rising and now 
 represent over 3 percent of total sales. What decisions have to be made before investing in an information 
system solution?
Improving Decision Making: Using Databases to Analyze Sales Trends
  Software skills: Database querying and reporting
Business skills: Sales trend analysis
In this project, you will start out with raw transactional sales data and use Microsoft Access database 
softw
are to develop queries and reports that help managers make better decisions about product  pricing, 
sales promotions, and inventory replenishment. In MyMISLab, you can find a Store and Regional 
Sales Database developed in Microsoft Access. The database contains raw data on weekly store sales 
of  computer equipment in various sales regions. The database includes fields for store identification 
number, sales region, item number, item description, unit price, units sold, and the weekly sales period 
when the sales were made. Use Access to develop some reports and queries to make this information 
more useful for running the business. Sales and production managers want answers to the following 
questions:
• Which products should be restocked?
• Which stores and sales regions would benefit from a promotional campaign and additional marketing?
• When (what time of year) should products be offered at full price, and when should discounts be used?

Mashaweer
CASE STUDY
M
ashaweer is the first personal service 
company in Egypt. It’s purely dedicated 
to saving its clients’ time and effort 
acting as a personal assistant 24 hours 
a day. The personal assistant is a rider with a motor-
cycle who runs any errands for individual clients or 
corporations at any given time. The most common 
service they provide is buying groceries or other 
goods from stores, paying bills, and acting as a courier. 
Mashaweer’s success relies heavily on their flexibility, 
and they have often received unusual requests that 
they have fulfilled in order to gain customer loyalty – 
including: going to the gym to tell someone to turn on 
the phone as someone is trying to reach them, deliv-
ering presents to a client’s fiancée every 15 minutes, 
and carrying a client’s shopping bags from the car to 
the house. 
Mashaweer is an essential service for the Egyptians 
because traffic is a problem that everyone in Egypt 
faces, making it difficult for an individual to get a 
couple of errands done on the same day. Mashaweer’s 
service has achieved such success in Alexandria and 
Cairo, where traffic is an issue, saving people one of 
the most valuable commodities out there; time. The 
service is  able to give people more quality time to 
spend with family or friends, instead of taking care 
of the daily errands that usually take up half of one’s 
day. They also act as a security or safety measure as 
they perform people’s errands in unsafe times, such 
as the period after the revolution or simply late at 
night. Most individuals cannot afford having a full 
time assistant to perform their errands whenever 
needed. Mashaweer’s agents act as full time assistants 
for every individual at a part time cost. 
Since starting the company in Alexandria in 2010, 
Mashaweer has since expanded to Cairo and oper-
ates around 600 orders per day. They plan to expand 
even further geographically within Egypt and to other 
countries in the region as well as enhancing and 
increasing the services they provide.
The idea of Mashaweer was created by Mohamed 
Wahid (24 years old) and then co-founded with his 
partners, Ahmed El Kordy (25 years old) and Aly El 
Shazly (27 years old). They were all born and raised 
in Alexandria. Ahmed El Kordy and Mohamed Wahid 
met when they both transferred from different schools 
to IGCSE Academy (AAST) for high school. Ahmed El 
Kordy finished high school in 2 years and went on to 
achieve his bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering 
from The Arab Academy of Science and T echnology 
(AAST), graduating in 2008. Part of his undergradu-
ate degree was spent doing a year abroad in Carleton 
University in Ottawa, Canada. During the summers 
of his undergraduate years, Ahmed completed sev-
eral internships in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
Mohamed Wahid also went to AAST graduating in 
2009 with a bachelor’s degree in construction engi-
neering. Aly El Shazly attended St. Marks School for 
his entire school career, he then went on to Alexandria 
University where he studied business and graduated 
in 2007. After college, Ahmed El Kordy went on to 
work at his father’s import/export business. Mohamed 
Wahid went on to establish a company called X-trade 
for trade and contracting, followed by a marketing and 
advertising company called Green Media. Currently, 
he’s a main shareholder in both, in addition to being 
the vice-chairman of Green T owers, a real estate com-
pany with a net worth of about $16 million.
Wahid thought of the idea of establishing 
Mashaweer while he was preparing for his wedding. 
His bride-to-be was overwhelmed with errands that 
she had to get done within a few days and he started 
wondering what she would have done if she couldn’t 
afford having a full time driver who did all of her 
errands for her. While on his honeymoon, he kept 
thinking about this idea and how much time people 
could save and what a valuable service it could be, so 
he decided to call his friends to start transforming the 
idea into an actual business plan. After developing 
a business plan, the three entrepreneurs decided to 
go into the implementation phase and actually build 
this business. They started small and grew organically 
as the demand for the service increased. Each of the 
three entrepreneurs invested $5,000 into the project 
to total a starting capital of $15,000. They started with 
only 3 motorcycles, 6 riders, and a hotline. 
As the three friends realized they had actually suc-
ceeded in Alexandria, they decided they wanted to 
move to the next phase by establishing Mashaweer 
in Cairo. When they decided to expand to Cairo, they 
decided to adopt a completely different strategy. 
They wanted to be able to cover all of Greater Cairo, 
as a whole, and not just specific areas, from the very 
beginning. During the Revolution in January 2011 
they started gathering market research to expand in 
Cairo and started investing heavily. Since business

all over the country had come to a standstill, they 
made several large purchases such as motorcycles and 
advertising space for fractions of the price. When oth-
ers saw it as a time to slow down, the entrepreneurs 
saw it as an opportunity to start marketing for their 
business. By March they realized that they needed to 
increase the original investment so that they can grow 
large enough to capture the market in Cairo. T o do 
so, they brought in other investors, mainly from their 
friends and family, to raise the capital investment up 
to $1.67 million. They planned to enter Cairo with full 
force so that there would be a high barrier of entry for 
any competitor they decided that their competitive 
advantage would have to be in investing in technol-
ogy. They wanted to get an ERP (Enterprise Resource 
Planning) system but found quotations to be too high. 
T o fix this they started their own information technol-
ogy company, Innov8 (innovate), where they created 
a customized ERP system, which they then connected 
to their customized PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) 
through a cloud computing system that was made by 
LinkDotNet and Mobinil. Each rider receives tasks 
one at a time on the PDA, which also includes a GPS 
to provide detailed directions. The GPS monitors the 
rider’s location. 
  T o reduce cost and ensure quality, Mashaweer 
does not rely on outsourcing in any of its stages 
as long as it can do the work with the same or bet-
ter quality. This explains why Mashaweer founded 
Innov8 in order to build its system and manage its 
technical work. Now, Mashaweer only owns part of 
this company and is one of its numerous clients. One 
further example of Mashaweer’s in house capabili-
ties is its call center. The company preferred to have 
an internal call center after rejecting a number of 
offers for an outsourced one. The reason for this was 
to be able to monitor the performance of the agents 
and always work on improving the quality of their 
customer service. Investing in an innovative contact 
center and using CISCO, which supports up to 300IP 
phones, a reporting module and a recording sys-
tem made it much easier for Mashaweer to track its 
received calls and work on any problems that might 
face its customer service agents.
Software components developed by Innov8 include 
the Mashaweer Server, Mashaweer API (Application 
Programmers’ Interface), and Mashaweer PDA client.
The Mashaweer Server is a centralized application 
that manages the following elements:         
• Orders (placement, editing, pricing, review,  
 tracking and reports)
• Routes management and optimization 
• Clients (management, reports, discounts)
• Packages tracking
• Contracts
• Call center
• Satellite offices
• Representatives
• Cash transactions and expenses tracking for  
 representatives and satellite offices
• Asset tracking of vehicles, PDAs and mobile  
 printers
• Management reports
The API is a method of integrating Mashaweer 
ordering system with third parties. This allows third 
parties to automate their delivery system and inte-
grate Mashaweer into their existing CRM/dispatching 
systems, opening a wide opportunity for business 
expansion.
The Mashaweer PDA application is installed on 
each representative PDA and manages the following 
elements:
• Order items progress tracking
• Collection of order fees and other costs,   
 against a printed invoice
• Package handling (barcode scanning and  
 destinations)
• Messaging
• Cash and expenses tracking
•  Synchronizing data periodically and at the 
beginning of each shift
When Mashaweer was first introduced in Egypt, 
it captured 100 percent of market share for such a 
service, because it was the first and only company 
of its nature. However, the market was not aware or 
used to such a service, so it started growing slowly 
in Alexandria until people grasped the idea and got 
accustomed to the fact that there is a company that 
can take over your errands. In contrast, when the 
company started operating in Cairo, it grew at surpris-
ingly fast pace. There are several factors are expected 
to affect the target market and make it easier for 
Mashaweer to penetrate it aggressively. 
At the beginning, people’s assumption is that using 
Mashaweer is too luxurious and costly. When they use 
it for the first couple of times, this perception changes 
and they begin to rely on this convenient service. 
As more and more people get accustomed with the 
service, it creates a cultural change that significantly 
affects the demand on the service. 
Another factor that is expected to facilitate work-
ing conditions and reduce costs is the technological 
advances that occur every day. Mashaweer heavily 
depends on technological tools, and would benefit 
from the advancements and price reductions that 
continuously take place. As a result, Mashaweer’s total

costs will decrease, enabling it to decrease its prices 
and further improve its quality to become even more 
convenient for a larger number of people. 
 Mashaweer is the only company of its kind in 
Egypt that operates on this scale. However, there is a 
company called Wassaly that was established in Cairo 
after Mashaweer’s success in Alexandria. This com-
pany operates on a much smaller scale. Their indirect 
competitors include other courier services (e.g. DHL, 
UPS, TNT, and FedEx). However, they have posi-
tioned themselves as the flexible courier in contrast 
to the couriers available in the market today; they 
offer same day delivery rather than next day delivery. 
Mashaweer has several other advantages that make it 
very hard for others to compete:
• Database of thousands of loyal clients.
• Self-investment is manageable. 
•  Highly qualified and carefully selected riders due 
to the high salaries compared to the delivery sec-
tor in the Egypt. 
• Various revenue streams. 
•  Being the owner of the IT company Innov8 fos-
ters technology integration in Mashaweer.
Mashaweer has several unique selling propositions. 
The main two aspects are being the first in the mar-
ket, and the only of its kind. Also the most important 
differentiator is the flexibility of their service, which 
addresses all of their customer’s needs and requests. 
Unlike new entrants or copycats in the market, 
Mashaweer have invested highly in the systems they 
use. They invested in PDAs to enable the opera-
tions process to be monitored accurately since it 
provides data like GPS tracking to track each order 
and the location or stage the messenger is located. 
Through this technology, Mashaweer decreases the 
amount of errors due to the fact that the messenger 
is tied to an automated process where he receives 
his tasks through the PDA handheld. Meanwhile, a 
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) 
system presented on a big screen will be available at 
Mashaweer headquarters to monitor all live orders 
and measure the traffic in case of rush hours, thus 
enabling the operation team to react and try a preven-
tive and corrective action.
Mashaweer’s infrastructures includes the following.
Equipment: 130 motorcycles units and 10 cars.
Software: A logistics management solution system 
was developed specifically for Mashaweer, and served 
from a cloud-hosted server. The solution consists of a 
web-based portal where call center agents, logistics, 
and managers can add, edit, track, and view reports.
 PDA: A PDA client was developed to connect to the 
server in order to allow Mashaweer representatives to view 
and update their assigned orders via an XML-based web 
service. Except for the PDA client, the solution is based 
on open source technologies (PHP , CodeIgniter, MySQL, 
jQuery, Ubuntu Linux). The PDA devices will be a main 
factor in integrating the operational team with the fleet of 
riders.
 Hardware: Windows Mobile PDAs were used for view-
ing and updating orders on the move. Each PDA is paired 
to a Bluetooth mobile printer for printing receipts. The 
printer is also equipped with a swipe card reader module 
so that it can be used in the future for credit card payment 
collection, and for promotion cards. Mashaweer server is a 
Linux VM hosted on a cloud solution provided by Innov8, 
the sister company that developed the entire information 
technology system.
 Head Quarters: The decision was made to buy a new 
headquarters instead of renting an existing one.
Mashaweer’s future strategy is as follows:
Mashaweer Market: Mashaweer Market is an online 
supermarket that will enable people to do their grocery 
shopping through Mashaweer’s website and get it deliv-
ered by its representatives within 30 minutes of placing 
the order. This will be made possible by having access 
to a large number of supermarkets around Cairo and 
Alexandria, so that representatives can pick the order from 
the closest outlet and deliver it to the customer as quickly 
as possible. All products will be displayed on the website. 
Mashaweer is hoping to reach an average of 4000 orders 
daily in return for a delivery charge of 5 Egyptian pounds 
per order. 
Call center: Mashaweer’s call center is expected to 
make up an important revenue stream for the company 
in the near future, as the company starts introducing mar-
keting campaigns. In addition, Mashaweer is planning to 
expand its call center to include other companies other 
than Mashaweer. 
Geographical Expansion: Using the technology they 
have invested in building their infrastructure, Mashaweer 
now has the potential to easily enter and penetrate other 
markets in different regions at a very low initiation cost. 
They plan to expand to other regions within Egypt, in 
addition to expanding to other countries within the Middle 
East. In October 2013 they will open their first franchise in 
Beirut, Lebanon. They are also looking to expand to sev-
eral countries in the Gulf.
