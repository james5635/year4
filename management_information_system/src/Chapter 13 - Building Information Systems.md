# 📘 Chapter 13 – Building Information Systems (Exam Summary)

## 🎯 Main Idea

Organizations build information systems to solve problems and improve performance.
This chapter explains **how systems are developed**, managed, and evaluated.

---

# 1️⃣ Systems as Organizational Change

Building a system is **not just technology** — it involves:

* 🧑‍💼 People
* 🏢 Organization
* 💻 Technology

New systems often require:

* New processes
* New skills
* Changes in workflow

---

# 2️⃣ Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) ⭐ IMPORTANT

The **SDLC** is the traditional method for building systems.

### 📌 1. Systems Analysis

* Identify problem
* Define requirements
* Feasibility study (technical, economic, operational)

### 📌 2. Systems Design

* Logical design (what system should do)
* Physical design (how system will work)

### 📌 3. Programming

* Writing the code

### 📌 4. Testing

* Unit testing
* System testing
* Acceptance testing

### 📌 5. Conversion

* Change from old system to new system
* Direct cutover
* Parallel
* Pilot
* Phased

### 📌 6. Production & Maintenance

* System operates
* Fix bugs
* Improve features

---

# 3️⃣ Alternative Systems-Building Approaches

Traditional SDLC is slow. So companies use faster methods:

### 🔹 Prototyping

* Build quick version
* Get user feedback
* Improve system

### 🔹 End-User Development

* Users build systems themselves
* Using tools like spreadsheets

### 🔹 Application Software Packages

* Buy ready-made software
* Customize if needed

### 🔹 Outsourcing

* Hire external company
* Cloud-based services

---

# 4️⃣ Agile Development ⭐ IMPORTANT

Agile = flexible, fast, iterative development.

Features:

* Small teams
* Continuous feedback
* Frequent releases
* Close user involvement

Focus: Deliver working software quickly.

---

# 5️⃣ Component-Based & Web Services Development

* Build systems using reusable components
* Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
* Web services communicate over internet

Goal: Faster development & lower cost

---

# 6️⃣ Managing Systems Development

Important management issues:

### 📌 Project Management

* Time
* Cost
* Scope

### 📌 Risk Factors

* Changing requirements
* Poor communication
* Lack of user involvement
