## 🎯 Main Idea

Poor project management = system failure.

# 1️⃣ What is Project Management?

Project management includes:

* Planning
* Organizing
* Directing
* Controlling resources

Goal: Achieve specific objectives within constraints.

---

# 2️⃣ Why Projects Fail ⭐ VERY IMPORTANT

Common causes:

* ❌ Unclear requirements
* ❌ Scope creep (requirements keep changing)
* ❌ Lack of user involvement
* ❌ Poor communication
* ❌ Unrealistic deadlines
* ❌ Lack of executive support

👉 Most failures are **management problems**, not technical problems.

# 3️⃣ The Triple Constraint Model ⭐

Every project has 3 main constraints:

1. **Scope** – What must be done
2. **Time** – Deadline
3. **Cost** – Budget

If one changes → others are affected.

Example:
Increase scope → need more time or cost.
