# 📘 Chapter 8: Securing Information Systems – Exam Summary

## 1️⃣ Why Information Systems Are Vulnerable

Information systems are vulnerable because they are:

* Connected to the **Internet**
* Accessible through **networks**
* Used by many people (including insiders)

### Main Sources of Threats:

* 🌐 **Internet vulnerabilities** (open networks, fixed IP addresses)
* 📡 **Wireless risks** (Wi-Fi hacking, war driving, rogue access points)
* 👨‍💼 **Internal threats** (employees, social engineering)
* 💻 **Software bugs and flaws**
* 🌪️ Natural disasters (fire, flood, power failure)

---

## 2️⃣ Malware (Malicious Software)

**Malware** = harmful programs that damage or steal data.

### Types:

* 🦠 **Virus** – attaches to files, spreads when user acts.
* 🐛 **Worm** – spreads automatically over networks.
* 🐴 **Trojan horse** – looks safe but is harmful.
* 👀 **Spyware** – secretly monitors users.
* ⌨️ **Keylogger** – records keystrokes.
* 💉 **SQL Injection** – attacks database through web input.

---

## 3️⃣ Hackers & Computer Crime

### Hacker Techniques:

* **Spoofing** – pretending to be someone else.
* **Sniffing** – intercepting network data.
* **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** – flooding a server to shut it down.
* **DDoS** – attack from many infected computers (botnet).

### Common Crimes:

* Identity theft
* Phishing (fake emails/websites)
* Click fraud
* Data breaches

---

## 4️⃣ Identity Theft & Phishing

* **Identity Theft** = stealing personal information.
* **Phishing** = fake emails/websites asking for sensitive info.
* **Spear phishing** = targeted phishing.
* **Pharming** = redirecting users to fake websites.
* **Evil twins** = fake Wi-Fi networks.

---

## 5️⃣ Internal Threats

Employees can:

* Share passwords
* Make data entry errors
* Be tricked by **social engineering**
* Intentionally steal data

⚠️ User ignorance is a major cause of breaches.

---

## 6️⃣ Software Vulnerability

* Software contains **bugs**
* Complex programs cannot be perfectly tested
* Vendors release **patches** to fix flaws

Zero defects are impossible in large systems.

---

## 7️⃣ Cyberwarfare & Global Threats

* **Cyberwarfare** = government-sponsored cyber attacks.
* Example: **Stuxnet worm** attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities.
* Modern cyberweapons are:

  * Highly sophisticated
  * Targeted
  * Hard to detect

---

## 8️⃣ Business Impact of Security Failures

Security breaches cause:

* 💰 Financial loss
* 🏷️ Reputation damage
* ⚖️ Lawsuits
* Operational shutdown

Example: LinkedIn password breach due to weak encryption and no salting.

---

# 🔑 Key Exam Definitions

* **Security** = protection against unauthorized access.
* **Controls** = policies & procedures ensuring safety and accuracy.
* **Malware** = malicious software.
* **Botnet** = network of infected computers.
* **DoS/DDoS** = system overload attack.
* **Phishing** = fake request for sensitive info.
* **Patch** = software fix.

# 🎯 What to Remember for Exam

✔ Systems are vulnerable because they are connected and complex.  
✔ Major threats: malware, hackers, insiders, software bugs.  
✔ Identity theft & phishing are major modern crimes.  
✔ Security requires policies, controls, and technology.  
✔ Cyberwarfare is growing and very serious.
