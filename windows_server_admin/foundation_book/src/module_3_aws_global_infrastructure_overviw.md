# AWS Global Infrastructure Overview

## 1. AWS Global Infrastructure

- The AWS Global infrastructure is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance.
- This map shows the current AWS regions and more that are coming soon

### AWS Region

- An AWS region is a geographical area
  - Data replication across Regions is controlled by you
  - Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure
- Each Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network
- A region typically consists of two or more availability zones

### Selecting a region

Determine the right region for your services, applications, and data based on these factors

- Data governance, legal requirements
- Proximity to customers (latency)
- Services available within the region
- Costs (vary by region)

### Availability Zones

- Each region has multiple availability zones
- Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure
  - There are currently 69 Availability zones worldwide
  - Availability zones consist of discrete data centers
  - They are designed for fault isolation
  - They are interconnected with other Availability Zones by using high-speed private networking
  - you choose you availability zones
  - AWS recommends replicating data and resource across Availability Zones for resiliency
  
### AWS data centers

- AWS data centers are designed for security
- Data centers are where the data resides and data processing occurs
- Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and is housed in a separate facility
- A data center typically has 50,000 to 80,000 physical servers

### Point of Presence

- AWS provide a global network of 187 Points of Presence locations
- Consists of 176 edge locations and 11 Regional edge caches
- Used with Amazon CloudFront
  - A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) that deliver content to end users with reduced latency
- Regional edge caches used for content with infrequent access

### AWS Infrastructure features

- Elasticity and scalability
  - Elastic infrastrructure; dynamic adaption of capacity
  - Scalable infrastructure; adapt to accommodate growth
- Falut-tolerance
  - Continues operating properly in the presence of a failure
  - Built-in redundancy of components
- High availability
  - High level of operational performance
  - Minimized downtime
  - No human intervention

## 2. AWS Service
