Great screenshot üëç ‚Äî this is from **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**, showing **built-in security groups** in Active Directory. These groups are created by default and provide specific administrative roles or permissions across the domain. Let me break them down:

---

### üîë Common Built-in Groups in AD

1. **Access Control Assistance Operators**

   * Can remotely query authorization attributes and permissions.

2. **Account Operators**

   * Can create, modify, and delete accounts (except for certain protected accounts like Administrators).

3. **Administrators**

   * Full control over the domain. Members are domain admins with unrestricted access.

4. **Backup Operators**

   * Can back up and restore files regardless of security permissions.

5. **Certificate Service DCOM Access**

   * Members can request and enroll for certificates from Certificate Services via DCOM.

6. **Cryptographic Operators**

   * Can perform cryptographic operations (e.g., manage cryptographic keys).

7. **Distributed COM Users**

   * Can launch, activate, and use Distributed COM objects remotely.

8. **Event Log Readers**

   * Read access to all event logs on domain controllers.

9. **Guests**

   * Temporary accounts with limited access.

10. **Hyper-V Administrators**

    * Manage Hyper-V virtual machines and related resources.

11. **IIS\_IUSRS**

    * Built-in group for IIS worker processes (used by IIS for application pools).

12. **Incoming Forest Trust Builders**

    * Can create incoming, one-way trusts to this forest.

13. **Network Configuration Operators**

    * Limited rights to manage TCP/IP settings and renew DHCP leases.

14. **Performance Log Users**

    * Can schedule performance counter logging.

15. **Performance Monitor Users**

    * Can monitor system performance counters.

16. **Pre-Windows 2000 Compatible Access**

    * Backward compatibility group for old systems (Windows NT 4.0).

17. **Print Operators**

    * Manage printers on domain controllers.

18. **RDS Endpoint Servers**

    * For Remote Desktop Services deployment.

19. **RDS Management Servers**

    * Manage Remote Desktop Session Hosts.

20. **RDS Remote Access Servers**

    * Enable Remote Desktop access.

21. **Remote Desktop Users**

    * Can log on remotely using RDP.

22. **Remote Management Users**

    * Permissions for remote management tools like PowerShell Remoting.

23. **Replicator**

    * Supports file replication in the domain.

24. **Server Operators**

    * Can manage server functions but with fewer rights than Administrators.

25. **Storage Replica Administrators**

    * Manage and configure Storage Replica.

26. **Terminal Server License Servers**

    * Used by Remote Desktop Licensing servers.

27. **Users**

    * Default group for domain users. Members can log on to the domain.

28. **Windows Authorization Access Group**

    * Allows read access to user account authorization attributes.

üëâ These groups are **security groups** (not distribution lists).
üëâ Best practice: assign permissions through groups, not directly to users.

Would you like me to also create a **table with group name, purpose, and best practice use** so you can keep it as a quick reference guide?
