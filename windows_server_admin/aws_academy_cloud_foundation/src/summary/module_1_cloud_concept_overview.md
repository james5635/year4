# Cloud Concepts Overview

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing

* **Cloud computing** = On-demand IT resources over the internet, pay-as-you-go.
* **Traditional model** = Hardware-based, costly, slow, requires capacity planning.
* **Cloud model** = Infrastructure as software, flexible, scalable, removes heavy lifting.
* **Service models**:

  * **IaaS** → most control (infrastructure).
  * **PaaS** → managed platform.
  * **SaaS** → least control (ready apps).
* **Deployment models**: Cloud, Hybrid, On-premises.
* AWS provides equivalents to traditional IT: compute, storage, networking, security.

## 2. Advantages of the Cloud

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense.
2. Massive economies of scale.
3. Stop guessing capacity (scale on demand).
4. Increased speed and agility (resources in minutes).
5. Eliminate cost of maintaining data centers.
6. Go global in minutes.

## 3. Introduction to AWS

* **Web service** = Software accessible over internet via APIs (JSON/XML).
* **AWS** = Secure cloud platform, broad set of global services, flexible, pay-per-use, building block approach.
* **Service categories**: Compute, Storage, Database, Networking, Security, Analytics, ML, etc.
* **Compute options**: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, Fargate, ECS, EKS, etc.
* **Ways to access AWS**: Console (GUI), CLI, SDKs.

## 4. Moving to AWS Cloud

* **AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)** = Guidance for cloud adoption.
* **Six perspectives**:

  * **Business** – align IT with business outcomes.
  * **People** – training, staffing, change management.
  * **Governance** – align IT strategy, manage portfolios and risks.
  * **Platform** – design/architect IT systems (compute, storage, network).
  * **Security** – IAM, data protection, incident response.
  * **Operations** – monitoring, change management, disaster recovery.

## 5. Module Summary

* Defined cloud models and benefits.
* Understood six advantages of cloud.
* Learned AWS core services & categories.
* Reviewed AWS CAF six perspectives.

**Sample exam Q:**
Why is AWS more economical for variable workloads?
✅ Because **EC2 instances can be launched on-demand when needed**.
