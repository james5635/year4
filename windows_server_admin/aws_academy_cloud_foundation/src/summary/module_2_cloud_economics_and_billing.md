### Payment Principles

* **Pay for what you use** â†’ No upfront costs
* **Pay less by using more** â†’ Volume discounts, tiered pricing
* **Pay even less as AWS grows** â†’ AWS passes cost savings from scale to customers
* **Custom Pricing** â†’ For high-volume or unique projects

### Free Tier & Services with No Charge

## 2. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

### On-premises vs AWS Cloud

| Traditional Infrastructure | AWS Cloud                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Hardware & facilities      | No upfront expense; pay as you go |
| Resource administration    | Scale up/down quickly             |
